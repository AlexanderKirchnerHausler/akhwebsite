### ABOUT ME
---
I am a post-doctoral researcher in Cultural Psychology at the University of Kent. My work explores the many dynamic ways culture is reproduced in our 
relationships and interactions with others around us, and particularly focuses on the important role of emotions in supporting cultural systems 
of being and relating (e.g. cultures of honor). 

My doctoral thesis *The Relationality of Feelings: A cultural comparison of affective patterns in Western and East-Asian relationships"* has 
been shortlisted for the Triandis Doctoral Thesis Award of the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology.
